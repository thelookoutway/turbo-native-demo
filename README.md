# Turbo Native Demo

A small app to demonstrate how to use Turbo with a native app. The demo app is available at [https://lookout-turbo-native-demo.glitch.me](https://lookout-turbo-native-demo.glitch.me)

## Running Locally

Clone the repo, and then:

```
$ npm install
$ npx nodemon
```

The server is running on [`localhost:45678`](http://localhost:45678). You can open that url in the browser and ensure the native app is using the same url.

Talk to Baz about that glitch.me deployment if you need to redeploy, not exactly sure how that works yet :)
